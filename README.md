# FPVtool (work in progress)

This app is a social network for FPV drone enthusiasts built on React Native and TypeScript. With a focus on exploration and community, our app allows users to discover new and exciting locations to fly their drones. Users can explore uploaded spots from other users, or add their own favorite locations to the map for others to see.

Our app's main features include a Explore section where users can browse uploaded spots from other users, and a Map section where they can view all spots and add new ones. Users can also create a profile, follow other users, and like or comment on uploaded spots.

In addition, the app has a range of filters and search options to help users find the perfect spot to fly their drone, including by location, type of terrain, and difficulty level. And with the ability to upload photos and videos of their flights, users can share their experiences and connect with other enthusiasts from around the world.
